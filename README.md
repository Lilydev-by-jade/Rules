# Rules

Rules is a highly-configurable server-side Fabric mod that allows
you to create and customize a `/rules` command. For customization,
Rules uses [Simplified Text Format](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/text-format/),
which means you can customize your rules pretty much ***any*** way you want,
as long as it's in that format!

## Configuration
